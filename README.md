OCamELF
=======

ELF-parsing library written in OCaml for OCaml

Strong requirements
-------------------

* OCaml >= 3.12
> http://caml.inria.fr/

* bistring >= 2.0.3
> http://code.google.com/p/bitstring/

Possibly optional requirements
------------------------------

If you want to build the examples using the Makefile, or want to build
anything using a similar compilation scheme, you will need ocamlbuild.
How to properly install and set this up is left as an exercise for the reader!

Specifics of getting a bitstring-enabled program to compile can be found on
this page:

Details are sordid, deal with it!
